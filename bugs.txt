board:
  for qfp, replace pic32 and remove mask from flag in pcb
  make 2-pin power supply jumpers also offset
  compare to bs50!

todo html:
  horizontal scrolling of trace on chromebook does not work
  calibration values stored in flash?
  add webusb auto load, allow usb stall, https://developer.chrome.com/articles/build-for-webusb/
  allow "measure" button to drag crosshairs (rather than place dot)
  allow display resize
  sample grid for manual clock recovery!
  (persistent) labels for binary bits?
  should we have an option for deep scrollable capture, using all of ram?
  fft display?
  option to export raw data?
  cal_zero should be cal_gnd?
  should we have two separate line segments on oor so we don't show red coming up or down the trace?
  need js functions to go forard and backward, and tests that they are reversible!
  controls -- maybe ditch b0?
  aliasing at right and left vertical marker vs. signal

toto StickOS:
  flash checksum
  on i2c reset do xxx (possibly just continue)
  add ms usb descriptor
  allow pin names in upper or lower case
  remove zigflea -- nodeid, remote variables, etc.
  get rid of cpustick/stickos/sources layers
  change all use of MASK to bits!
  mass storage ***
  overclock if s1 not pressed on boot?  20 Msps?
  download and clone?
  test "out of variables"
  test/implement open_drain pins?  other qualifiers?
  pullups for all unused/disconnected pins -- not near analog sample pins!!!
  rc10 should be driven low when wave is not in use
  heartbeat led does not blink while waiting for trigger (well, yeah)
  80 character line limit?

sparkfun vid???

write full internals doc for class!

VIDEO!!!

clear
configure uart 1 for 9600 baud 8 data no parity
dim a as byte, b as byte
a=55
uart 1 write a
uart 1 read b
print b

clear
configure uart 2 for 9600 baud 8 data no parity
dim a as byte, b as byte
a=77
uart 2 write a
uart 2 read b
print b

turn rb12 high output on dm mini to enable 3.3v on UEXT.

make all parts support 20 scopes (rather than 10).

allow gosub to use string expression instead of a label -- gosub state$

add "eval" command?  add case/switch command?

allow heartbeat and safemode* on same pin!

get rid of all code in #defines -- esp ?: and such for flash generations
get rid of all (*xxx)++ references
uniq -d long lines (if, else, while, etc.)
merge const parsing
replace all switch statements out of performance path with if-elseif

allow upper case letters in hex addresses.

turn off pcache for pic32; disable interrupts while talking to spi/i2c; see eratta

change duinomite pin names to match silkscreens (and fb32/chipKIT), change help pins, change default "pins" to remove zigflea and move safemode, change default heartbeat led
add stickos library versions that use all 512k for pic32 just like for CFV2 -- make an official part of the skeleton project!

data_image_begin is wrong for pic32 -- we have to use address after ramfunc images as the end of code!

add "upload" command to turn BASIC programs into S19/HEX...

I was hoping "ipaddress" would tell me what it got but that seems to just report "dhcp" or whatever static address was assigned.

// prior 1
// =======
// make run_var() extern and add to run.h!
// add windows/linux build to skeleton project
// "step" and "trace" should be statements, not commands!
// remove 4 pwm assignments from 5225x online help
// add "lcd init" statement...
// configure/on timer (n) should be able to take variables for (n)
// you can't copy keychar$ with "let temp$=keychar$", since there are three nul-bytes on big-endian memory in start of keychar$! (doc error!)
// # on string should still return max len -- @ should return consumed length! (or swap!)
// can we allocate more ram to pic32/5225x (ram page size)?  how close are we?
// add qspi and i2c pin assignments to online help (data, clk, cs)
// add to help pins all "unchangable" pins (i2c, spi, etc.) from freescale.pdf and microchip.pdf
// add help for uno32 LED on pin 43
// disable kbd pins for fb32 nano/mini
// eliminate restrictions on "analog" mode values.  "servo", too?
// add "configure qspi baud (n) mode (0-3)"
// add "configure i2c baud (n)"
// allow "library" sub in "library" to create global variables somehow.  call this by convention to initialize library.
// fix cpustick.inf to pass chkinf!
// fix CFV1 to tolerate uart overruns on rx, just like pic32; CFV2 might need help, too, so you don't have to reconfigure.
// allow you to set stop bits in the "configure" statement; switch all to 1 stop bit!
// stickos should report uart framing errors and overrun errors more gracefully!  on uart 1 error do gosub recover
// I should probably allow "as byte" or "as word" on pin variables, but I don't currently.
// get rid of parse2/run2/basic0 if we make stickos source public?
// fix checksum to be compatible/consistent with bootloader (pic32 and freescale)
// pins should survive upgrade; same for nodeid, ipaddress, etc.
// do we want BASIC to have control over pull-ups?  thru a mode variable?
// why does jm upgrade show diff checksum (by 0x5a?) than program from cw?
// multi-pin variables (digital I/O only, using binary integer)!!!
// add packed save/load commands!!!; make flash filesystem allocate only as much space as is needed to save a current program!
// mode to disable usb device (and autorun disable to override)
// move block.c and fat32.c from pict-o-crypt to sources (include in skeleton)
// on/off/mask/unmask should move to parse2.c/run2.c
// 9s12 and others need to reset timer counter when increasing frequency output -- see "wrap"
// Ctrl-E to dump all variables while basic program is running?
// add ability to get stack trace with locals from all frames
// add a faster zigflea option for pic32/5225x!

// update user's guide to indicate keychar and getchar automatically reset to 0 after they are read.

// prior 2
// =======
// fgure out a clean way for spi/i2c to steal pins
// expose erase_page and write_word to basic to manipulate other half of flash!

// if data area of flash looks bogus on boot, we should clear it all!
// have nodeid and clusterid, and broadcast 0x4242 and clusterid as magic number

// need a second catalog page for safe updates!
// handle uart errors (interrupt as well as poll)

// prior 3
// =======
// PC/Cell framework!!!
// add mst interface for basic progs and fw access, also inf file access
// add zigbee support thru xbee for ubw32?
